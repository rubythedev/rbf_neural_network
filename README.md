# rbf_neural_network
A custom implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network, designed for nonlinear function approximation and pattern recognition tasks. By utilizing Gaussian radial basis functions, the network learns to model complex relationships between input and output data, making it ideal for applications in regression and classification.
